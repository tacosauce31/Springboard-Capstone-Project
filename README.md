Used car market analysis


The purpose of my project is to analyst data from various auto auctions and display the outcome of a certain quarter's results and/or sells. 

One certain problem I want to solve is to why a certain model of vehicle is not selling as well as others. 

The client for my project is for finance companies in the remartketing market. It's for those companies that sell used car (repo purposes) and try to get back as much money back from repossessed vehicles. Hopefully, my forecasting skills will determine whether a certain model of vehicle is worth reselling at auction or whether to cut losses. 

The data used in this project will be from data respositories online. I've found multiple datasets in for a particular auction or place of sell that will show the information about the cars and how much they sold for

My approach to this project is to find all vehicles that did not sell well at auction. To calculate that, I'd find a relationship between how much is owed on the vehicle vs. how much the vehicles sold at auction. My project will analyze and display those vehicle that did not sell well.
